# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of Kickstarter data to find trends on media and entertainment kickstarters

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to explain to Louise how successful different kickstarter campaigns were based on multiple factors including goal amount, pledged amount, country origin, date, and entertainment categories/subcategories. We used this data to determine appropriate goal amount, start date of kickstarter, and the duration of the kickstarter.
