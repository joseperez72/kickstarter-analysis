# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to explain to Louise how successful different kickstarter campaigns were based on multiple factors including goal amount, pledged amount, country origin, date, and entertainment categories/subcategories. We used this data to determine appropriate goal amount, start date of kickstarter, and the duration of the kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges



## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

- My two conclusions are:

1) The month with the most successful kickstarters was May, followed by June, then July. Furthermore, The end of spring is the best time to launch a kickstarter, and is not recommended to launch one after the end of summer.

2) When you filter out the months May through July, The two lines follow the same trend, meaning that the ratio between successful and failed kickstarter is almost the same. The lines peak and valley at the same time.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- My conclusion is that lower goal amounts tend to be more successful than goals with a high goal amount. A goal amount in the $0 - $9,999 amount have more successful kickstarter than it does failed kickstarters. Another goal range that had more successful kickstarters than failed was the $35,000 - $44,999 range, however, there is not enough data to back up that theory. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?



### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
